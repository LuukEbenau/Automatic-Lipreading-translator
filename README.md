# Code writing instruction
For each sub-feature of our program



## Documentation & Communication
We have not discussed it yet in detail, but what we did discuss is to make primarily use of github for the means of documentation and communication. We will use this Readme.MD for general information, the Getting Started, Etc. For anything more detailed, we can use the github Wiki. Just click on [wiki](https://github.com/LuukEbenau/Automatic-Lipreading-translator/wiki) in the header, and you can add pages for each of the subjects. We can for example make a page for each of the modules in the code, 1 page about architecture, etc. By putting it all in the github we make sure that everyone has access to the right information, and additionally it will safe us a lot of work for the final report.
## Code & Source Control
One way of working which I usually like is having feat/ feature branches for features which dont work yet, development branch for partial work and stable code on the main branch. Based on what you guys prefer we can do mandatory code reviews & pull requests for pushing to the main branch, But i'm also okay with ommiting this, and just bearing the responsibility of not pushing broken code to the main branch :) Lets discuss about these things in the next meeting(s).
